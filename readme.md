#create an initial commit

only one person is doing this

Create a file in your folder (readme.md)
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git push (password problem: open git bash as admin and paste:git config --system --unset credential.helper)

Task:
-each coworker in the group creates a branch. Use a name like feature/name-of-the-feature. Pretend you are working on a specific task

-modify some files
-do a git add (track/stage) and create a commit
-push your branch
-other coworkers should see them (after a git fetch or after gitkraken refreses the view)
